## Learned: 

<br>
With this project I reminded myself how is better to break up a project to separate components <br>
and how to use CSS-modules for each component.

## Bugs:

- [ ] When Grid component is abled then the audio and Smoke motion not working.<br>
       Smoke and audio only works when Grid component is disabled. Fix when time.
